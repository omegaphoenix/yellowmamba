David Qu and Justin Leong
CS 2 Assignment 9/10

David's Contribution: Wrote initial heuristic, recursive minmax, and worked on improving the heuristic to account for mobility, frontier discs, corners, adajacency to corners and other factors. Changed player-valgrind.sh to work with yellowmamba so memory leaks could be fixed. Helped fix memory leaks in person.
